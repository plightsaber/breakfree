# ReadMe
Thanks for using the BreakFree restraint system!  Here's a few things you should know before you begin.

## Setup
You should have been delivered a folder containing the following items:
- Breakfree (directory)
- Breakfree 3.1.0
- Changelog
- Readme

### RLV
Since BreakFree is highly modular, it relies on RLV queries to attach the restraints as required.  As such, you need to do the following to make sure that BreakFree works properly.
1. Use RLV-compatible viewer.
2. Move the BreakFree directory under the top level #RLV directory in your Inventory.

### Attachments
The only attachment you need to worry about is the BreakFree object in the delivered folder.  Move this wherever you want in your inventory and attach it when you want to use the BreakFree System

## Using BreakFree
Better documentation is coming later.  For now, after attaching BreakFree, click the object (it should be an invisible cylinder on your torso) and click around.  Just don't get too tied up in your testing!

### User Settings
You can customize how your BreakFree set behaves. While unbound, you will have an "Options" button when touching your BreakFree object.
* RP Mode - When enabled, the escape game is disabled and any avi has full access to your restraints.

## Contribute
BreakFree is modular and fully open source.  While maintained by Myshel Neiro and Rachel Kyomoon, we are happy to review community-contributed fixes, features, and modules.  

The code and other resources are available @ https://github.com/plightsaber/breakfree if you are interested in helping with the development of this system.
